Prerequisites
AWS Account: Ensure you have access to an AWS account with sufficient permissions.

Terraform: Install Terraform here.

AWS CLI: Install and configure AWS CLI here.

Docker: Install Docker here.

Authentication Setup
AWS CLI
Make sure the AWS CLI is configured with the following command:

aws configure
This will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and Region. Alternatively, export the AWS credentials:


export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
Deployment Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecs-deployment-infrastructure.git
cd ecs-deployment-infrastructure
2. Configure the Container Image
Update the container_image variable in terraform.tfvars to the image you wish to deploy. Example:


container_image = "your-docker-image:latest"
Ensure that the image is available in a public or private container registry, such as Docker Hub or AWS ECR.

3. Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize the Terraform configuration:


terraform init
This downloads the necessary provider plugins.

4. Plan the Infrastructure
Review the Terraform execution plan before applying it:


terraform plan
5. Apply the Terraform Configuration
To deploy the infrastructure and start your containerized application, run:


terraform apply
Terraform will show the resources it will create and prompt for confirmation. Type yes to proceed.

6. Access the Application
Once the deployment is complete, Terraform will output the public URL of your load balancer. Visit this URL in a browser to access your application.

7. Destroy the Infrastructure (if needed)
To destroy the deployed resources and clean up, use the following command:

terraform destroy
This will remove all the AWS resources created by Terraform.
